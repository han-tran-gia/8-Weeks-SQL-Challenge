There are 14 pizzas that were ordered

***

### 2. How many unique customer orders were made?
```
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT order_id) as pizza_ordered
FROM customer_orders_temp
```

#### Explanation:
- The question is asking `unique customer order` which means if a customer ordered 2 pizzas in 1 order and the table is showing 2 records with the same order_id, we just count it as 1

#### Answer:

There are 10 unique customer orders.

### 3. How many successful orders were delivered by each runner?
```
SELECT runner_id
		,COUNT (pickup_time) AS successful_order_count
FROM runner_orders_temp
WHERE pickup_time != ''
GROUP BY runner_id
ORDER BY runner_id
```

#### Explanation:
- From the runner_orders_table: 2 records which are cancelled didn't have any information about pickup_time, duration and distance -> Using **WHERE** clause with criteria `pickup_time != '' to exclude these cancelled orders, the remaining records are successful delivered orders.

- Runner 1: has 4 successful delivered orders
- Runner 2: has 3 successful delivered orders
- Runner 3: has 1 successful delivered order

### 4. How many of each type of pizza was delivered?
```
SELECT pizza_name AS pizza
		,COUNT(order_id) AS pizza_count
FROM orders
JOIN pizza_runner.pizza_names
  USING (pizza_id)
GROUP BY pizza_name
ORDER BY pizza
```

#### Explanation:
- The question is asking how many pizza was delivered which means we need to exclude the cancelled order because they haven't delivered yet -> I will use orders table instead of runner_orders_temp table
- **JOIN**: To get the pizza names, I will join orders table with pizza_names table

#### Answer:

- Meatlovers: 9 delivered pizzas
- Vegetarian: 3 delivered pizzas

***

### 5. How many Vegetarian and Meatlovers were ordered by each customer?**
```
,pizza_info AS
	(SELECT *
	FROM customer_orders_temp
	LEFT JOIN pizza_runner.pizza_names
		USING (pizza_id))

SELECT customer_id AS customer
		,pizza_name
		,COUNT (pizza_name) AS pizza_count
FROM pizza_info
GROUP BY customer_id, pizza_name
ORDER BY customer, pizza_name
```

#### Explanation:
- The question is asking the number of pizzas were ordered and didn't mention about delivery status, therefore, I will include both cancelled order and using `customer_orders_temp` table

#### Answer:

```
SELECT order_id AS order
		,COUNT(pizza_id) AS max_pizza
FROM orders
GROUP BY order_id

#### Answer:
<img width="469" alt="image" src="https://github.com/han-tran-gia/8-weeks-sql-challenge/assets/144699083/b6032890-af22-4913-9111-333428d40aaa">

### 7. For each customer, how many delivered pizzas had at least 1 change and how many had no changes?
```
SELECT customer_id AS customer
		,SUM(CASE
        			WHEN exclusions = '' AND extras = '' THEN 1
            		ELSE 0 END) 
         AS no_change_pizza
        ,SUM(CASE
        			WHEN exclusions != '' OR extras != '' THEN 1
            		ELSE 0 END)
         AS at_least_1change
FROM orders
GROUP BY customer_id
ORDER BY customer_id
```
#### Explanation:
- For `delivered pizza` -> I will use orders table which has been exclude cancelled orders
- For `at least 1 change`: which means we need to count both situations: customers add extras or exclude any toppings from the pizza
- **CASE WHEN**: I used 2 CASE WHEN to calculate the number of no change and at least 1 change pizza
  - If `exclusions` and `extras` columns are blank, which means no toppings are added or excluded from the pizza, 1 will be added and later sum all of that to calculate no_change_pizza count
  - If these columns are NOT blank, which means at least 1 topping will be added or excluded from the pizza, 1 will be added and later sum all of that to calculate at_least_1change count

#### Answer:
<img width="703" alt="image" src="https://github.com/han-tran-gia/8-weeks-sql-challenge/assets/144699083/7a5de81e-a148-41ce-a4d3-e4cf5ba8c201">

There are 6 delivered pizzas had at least 1 change and 6 delivered pizzas had no change:
  - Customer 101 and 102: there are 2 and 3 no change pizzas were delivered to these 2 customers, respectively
  - Customer 103 and 105: there are 3 and 1 delivered pizzas that have at least 1 change, respectively
  - Customer 104: received 1 no change pizza and 2 pizzas that have at least 1 change

```
SELECT SUM(CASE
        		WHEN exclusions != '' AND extras != '' THEN 1
            ELSE 0 END) 
         AS both_excl_extra_pizza_count
FROM orders
```
#### Explanation:
- The question is asking the number of pizza were delivered so I will use orders table which has been excluded cancelled orders

#### Answer:

FROM customer_orders_temp
