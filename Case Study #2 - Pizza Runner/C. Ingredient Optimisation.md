### 2. What was the most commonly added extra?
```
,get_data AS
  (SELECT DISTINCT order_id, topping_name, extras
  FROM 
      (SELECT order_id, customer_id, pizza_id
              ,CAST(UNNEST(STRING_TO_ARRAY(extras, ',')) AS INT)	AS extras 
      FROM customer_orders_temp) AS extras_table
  LEFT JOIN topping_list
      ON extras_table.extras = topping_list.topping_id
  LEFT JOIN pizza_runner.pizza_toppings
      USING (topping_id))

SELECT topping_name
		  ,COUNT(extras) AS extras_count
FROM get_data
GROUP BY topping_name
ORDER BY extras_count DESC
```

#### Explanation:
- **extras_table**: Create a subquery called `extra_table` to convert comma separated values to rows using `string_to_array` and `unnest` functions
- In the outer query, join 2 tables `topping_list` and `pizza_runner.pizza_toppings` to get the name of the ingredients.

### 3. What was the most common exclusion?
```
,exclusions_table AS
  (SELECT order_id
          ,customer_id
          ,pizza_id
          ,CAST(UNNEST(STRING_TO_ARRAY(exclusions, ',')) AS INT) AS exclusions 
          ,order_time
  FROM customer_orders_temp)

SELECT topping_name
		  ,COUNT(exclusions) AS exclusions_count
FROM exclusions_table
LEFT JOIN topping_list
	ON exclusions_table.exclusions = topping_list.topping_id
	AND exclusions_table.pizza_id = topping_list.pizza_id
LEFT JOIN pizza_runner.pizza_toppings
	USING (topping_id)
GROUP BY topping_name
ORDER BY exclusions_count
```
